- ### Design
    - #### Site colours
        - the site primarily features muted greyscale colours, with #dddddd being used for background elements and #333333 for content, to provide a sophisticated and well-contrasted design. Other colours feature where appropriate, with images providing the bulk of colour to enhance the user experience

    - #### Site font
        - the site font is set to Open Sans throughout, with Sans Serif chosen in the event that Open Sans fails. Open Sans is clearly legible, having been:
            > optimized for print, web, and mobile interfaces
            - [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans#about)

    - #### Site images
        - the images throughout the site provide the bulk of colour to the pages, and have been chosen to reflect the quality of the content. The hero image on the home page inspires with a will to fly. The images from the who, what, why section compel thoughts on the beauty of the Welsh countryside, the excitement of drone flying, and the sense of community to be gained from the club, respectively. The background image of the events page relates to the inherent outdoorsness of drone flying, while the background image of the join page features a drone pilot -- a representation of the user.
